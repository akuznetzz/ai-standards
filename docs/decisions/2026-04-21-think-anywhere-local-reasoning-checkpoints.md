## Context

The `Think-Anywhere` paper on code generation shows that reasoning is most useful when it is invoked on demand at points of local uncertainty, rather than only in a single upfront planning block. The existing `reasoning-hygiene` and `autonomy-boundaries` process features already covered stepwise analysis and stop conditions, but they did not yet say explicitly that non-trivial implementation work should re-check assumptions inside the current slice.

## Decision

Extend the process standards so that:

- `reasoning-hygiene` requires local re-evaluation during implementation, especially around high-risk fragments and boundary-sensitive logic.
- `autonomy-boundaries` requires local checkpoints inside a slice, not only end-of-slice verification, and stops when local fixes no longer converge.
- the English and Russian usage guides explain this implementation-time reasoning pattern explicitly.

## Why

- matches the article's core practical lesson without copying model-specific training details
- keeps reasoning focused on the places where correctness risk is highest
- fits the existing split between analysis quality and autonomy limits
- makes the standards more actionable for agents that work in short implementation slices

## Alternatives Considered

### Keep the existing guidance unchanged

Rejected because the current rules already support stepwise reasoning in general, but they do not make the local implementation checkpoint pattern explicit.

### Create a new dedicated feature for slice-level reasoning checkpoints

Rejected because the new guidance fits naturally inside the existing `reasoning-hygiene` and `autonomy-boundaries` split.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- agents have a clearer expectation to re-check assumptions during implementation
- review becomes easier because local risk points are surfaced earlier
- autonomy stops sooner when a slice stops converging

### Costs Or Tradeoffs

- the standards gain a little more detail
- downstream prompts may need a small update to use the new local-checkpoint wording

## Affected Modules

- `fragments/process/reasoning-hygiene.md`
- `fragments/process/autonomy-boundaries.md`
- `docs/reasoning-hygiene-usage.md`
- `docs/reasoning-hygiene-usage.ru.md`
- `docs/autonomy-boundaries-usage.md`
- `docs/autonomy-boundaries-usage.ru.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

## Invariants And Constraints

- shared standards should remain concise and reusable across projects
- local checkpoints must stay focused on correctness risk, not become generic verbosity rules
- autonomy limits still depend on explicit session envelopes and reviewable stop conditions

## Verification

- the updated fragments are rendered into `AGENTS.md`
- the English and Russian usage guides describe local reasoning and intra-slice checkpoints
- `scripts/ai_sync.py render` and `scripts/ai_sync.py check` pass
